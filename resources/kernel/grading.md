# Grading

## code:
* first things first, i getting error on both the bootblock and createimage. I dont even get a image to test or check :).
* Create a readme.md file so i know if there is anything special i need to do to run your code. Which should not be.
* When i run your bootblock, the kernel test does not even run like it should.
* When i run you createimage i get a buffer overflow error?
* i dont really see if you have taking care of the case if there are n-amount of files to be written in the image.
* The structure can be improved. One thing that you understand the code, another thing is to make sure other people can understand it.
* I see you have added comments which is good! But i wish there were more comments on different parts that are doing very specific things.

## report:
* Good report, especially the design and implementation part. I really like how you have explained the different parts of the code and how it works in a really good and abstract way. 
* Nice use of figures and references!
* amazing discussion part!
* the report structure has room for improvment
* Like thenical background part.


## grade:
Even through the report is good, i cant compile your good. I cant see how the image even looks, because no image is produced. 

Make sure that i can compile your code and check it.You have until 06.02.2023 mondag.
